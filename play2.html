<h4 class="name GERALD">GERALD</h4>  <p class="speech">I don’t wish to leave my mother.</p>

<h4 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> <p class="speech"> Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.  Not
leave your mother!  If I were your mother I would insist on your going.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ ALICE L.C.]</p>

<h4 class="name ALICE">ALICE</h4>  <p class="speech">Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad
headache, and cannot see any one this morning. </p> 
<p class="stage-direction">[_Exit_ R.C.]</p>
<h4 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADYHUNSTANTON</h4>  
<p class="stage-direction">[_Rising_.]</p>  <p class="speech">A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps
you’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,
Gerald.</p>

<h4 class="name GERALD">GERALD</h4>  <p class="speech">I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.</p>

<h4 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> <p class="speech"> Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father,
Gerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off
with Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to
their sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I
must call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,
is far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite
wonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.
Good-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.</p>

<h4 class="name MRSALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY</h4>  <P class="speech">Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.</P>

<h4 class="name GERALD">GERALD</h4> <p class="speech"> Good-bye.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[_Exit_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD _sits down and reads
over his letter_.]</p>
